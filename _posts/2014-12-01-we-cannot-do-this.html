Since I started helping other software developers to improve their work I get told frequently &quot;We cannot do this&quot; when I propose a new technique and my response is always &quot;Have you tried it?&quot; In the reply they present all kinds of reasons why &quot;the company&quot;, &quot;the management&quot;, &quot;the boss&quot; or some other functional unit within the company will not allow it.
